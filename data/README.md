Place your datasets here.

This folder contains a small synthetic example in `data/example/` used by the demo. Replace the files with real datasets using the same expected layout.

Expected layout for each sample (example):
- `text_samples.jsonl`: lines of JSON objects {"id":..., "text":..., "traits": {"O":..., ...}, "emotion": "happy"}
- `audio_sample.wav`: short WAV file for demo
- `video_sample.mp4`: short MP4 for demo

When adding real data, ensure you follow the consent checklist in `scripts/collect_consent_template.md`.
